## Data Structures
Stores and organizes a collections of objects

## Collections Framework
Unified architecture that provides data structures and algorithms to manipulate them.
Collections can only hold objects and not primitive types.
For example, Integer would be the wrapper class that represents an integer data type
  
## Common collections
- Set, list, queue and map

## Set
- Unordered collection of unique objects

## List
- Ordered elements accessible by position and can contain duplicate elements

## Queue (First in, First Out)
- Collection of ordered elements that are processed in the order in which they're added
- Allow for duplicate elements

All of the others inherit from the collection interface

## Map
- Map does not inherit from the collection interface
- Map holds key-value pairs
- Maps take objects, the key is an object and the value is an object
- Map cannot contain duplicate keys, the keys must be unique

## Collection iterators
Map doesnt have access to Iterator


## Enhanced for loops

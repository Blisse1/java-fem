## Streams Operations
- anyMatch() Terminal Operation -> it is a terminal operation. So it is no other operation you can do after it
- allMatch() Terminal Operation -> does all match this condition?
- filter() Intermediate operation -> filter this stream to only the elements that matches the condition that I've given it

- it is normal to put a letter to identify like each one of the elements when using lambda functions when the lambda is short but if it is more
- logic to it it is preferable to decide upon a more meaningful variable name
- forEach() it is a terminal operation also

## Stream operations that allow you to manipulate data (not original source)
- map()

Method reference is usual when working with streams

- reduce() Terminal Operation
